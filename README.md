## Introduction:

This is a simple task management application built using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). The application allows users to create, update, and delete tasks. Tasks have a title, description, and status (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Done"). Users can view a list of tasks and filter them by status.
